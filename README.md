# ImageStack Bundle

A PHP image serving framework.

The main goal is to provide a robust framework to create an "on the fly" image thumbnailer generator similar to [imagecache](https://www.drupal.org/project/imagecache) / [image style](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/image/working-with-images) in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).

You can also use it to build a singlepoint multipurpose proxy server on top of a "complex" / legacy(ish) / not-yet-migrated images structure.

Here is a [Symfony 4](https://symfony.com/4) bundle for [ImageStack](https://github.com/quazardous/ImageStack).

## Installation

    composer require quazardous/imagestack-bundle

## Config

see [Resources/doc/index.rst](https://github.com/quazardous/imagestack-bundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.rst)

## Usage

The above config will let you have a `./images/` private folder hold original images and serves them from `images/...`.

It defines some thumbnail rules and activates images optimizers.

Say you need to display `./images/foo/cool_image.jpg` with thumbnail style.

Just hit `images/style/thumb/foo/cool_image.jpg` and voil√† !

Behind the curtain, Imagestack we generate and optimize `images/style/thumb/foo/cool_image.jpg`, store it in `./public/images/style/thumb/foo/cool_image.jpg` and serve it to your browser.

So next HTTP call will be statically serverd.

## Advanced usage

With **Imagestack** you can stack components like bricks.

Say you need to serve images from your new CMS but also images from old stuff you have imported "as it" with heteroclite image sources...

You can build a stack with a sequential image backend wich will try to fetch given path from different backends including "legacy" HTTP Proxy backends.

You can of course internally rewrite the path with "kitchen rules" to fetch the legacy images.

## Twig

Imagestack has a Twig filter and function `imagestack`.

```html.twig
...
<img src="{{ 'foo/cool_image.jpg'|imagestack('style/thumb') }}"/>
...
```
